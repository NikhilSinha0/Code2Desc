# Code2Desc
This project aims to figure out whether it is possible to generate descriptions of code behavior based on the code itself.
To do this we are using NLP techniques to parse out succinct code blocks and description intent using questions from StackOverflow,
and then using that to train a GAN or VAE (at the moment still to be decided) so as to be able to generate descriptions from input code blocks.
